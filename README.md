# File structure (FÃ¶rslag)
- "requirements.txt", ".gitignore" and very general files in this top-level.

- Top Level - "parts_and_ros"-folder
    - "ml"-folder
        - Everything strictly related to the Machine Learning part of the project goes here

    - "ros"-folder
        - Everything strictly related to the ROS part of the project goes here

    - Dataset goes in top-level folder

# Ideas Machine Learning Part
- Normal Object Detection(YOLOv5?, more) on objects lying flat and include rotation as input somehow
    - Ratio between width and height of bounding box to approximate rotation?
    - Compute ideal grabbing point from bounding box and type of part
- Detect occluded objects (partially visible objects)?
- Do something with Aruco tags?
- 6D Object Detection with EfficientPose

- Facebook's Detectron2 using PyTorch (Removes empty space in bounding box, kind of)
